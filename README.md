# JavaScript Console

Simple JavaScript console. Open source alternative to [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) and [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com).

## Why?
I needed a convenient way to quickly run JavaScript code without having to open VSCode or a terminal. Other alternatives I found were either too bloated with a heavy focus on HTML and CSS, or too basic with unreliable logging. So, I decided to build my own JavaScript console using the same editor that VSCode uses, which provides a lot of handy features right out of the box.

## Features
- Code Completion
- Enhanced logging capabilities
- Lightweight and user-friendly
- Localstorage support for data persistence
- Powered by [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) editor for a rich editing experience
